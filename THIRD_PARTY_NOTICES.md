# Third-Party Notices

GenieX-QAIRT-plugin is licensed under the BSD 3-Clause License (see
[`LICENSE.txt`](LICENSE.txt)). It ships with or depends on the following
third-party components, each governed by its own license.

## 1. Qualcomm AI Runtime (QAIRT) SDK

**Location in tree:** `qnn-api/` (both `src/` and `include/`, including
`include/HTP/` and `include/System/`).

**Origin:** Files extracted verbatim from the Qualcomm AI Runtime SDK
(QAIRT), downloadable from
https://www.qualcomm.com/developer/software/qualcomm-ai-engine-direct-sdk.
Version at time of extraction: v2.36.1.250708151608_123266 (per
`qnn-api/include/QnnSdkBuildId.h`), declaring QNN C API 2.27.0. This is
intentionally older than the runtime libraries in item 2; see
[`qnn-api/README.md`](qnn-api/README.md).

**License:** Qualcomm AI Runtime SDK End User License Agreement (EULA)
as distributed with the SDK download. These files are proprietary
Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. code and are **not** relicensed under
BSD-3-Clause. The original per-file copyright and "Confidential and
Proprietary" markings are preserved.

See [`qnn-api/README.md`](qnn-api/README.md) for refresh instructions.

## 2. QAIRT Prebuilt Runtime Libraries

**Location in tree:**
- `third-party/windows/` — Windows ARM64 runtime libraries.
- `third-party/android/` — Android ARM64 runtime libraries.
- `third-party/linux-gcc11.2/` — Linux aarch64 (gcc 11.2 ABI) runtime libraries.

**Origin:** Prebuilt `.dll` / `.so` binaries shipped as part of a QAIRT SDK
release. Version: v2.45.0.260326 — a different, newer release than the headers
in item 1.

**License:** Qualcomm AI Runtime SDK EULA (same as item 1).

## 3. geniex-proc

**Location in tree:** `third-party/geniex-proc/` (git submodule).

**Origin:** Sibling project providing tokenizer and preprocessing
utilities, vendored as a submodule.

This submodule transitively vendors additional libraries under
`third-party/geniex-proc/third-party/` (xtensor, xtensor-blas, xtensor-io,
xtl, tokenizers-cpp, msgpack, etc.); each carries its own license file in
its respective directory.
